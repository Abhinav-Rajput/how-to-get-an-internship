# How to get an internship

Do you want to get better at programming while improving job prospects and making some good money on the side? You should do an internship in technology!

I've had 3 internships -- one at a company doing web development, one at a really cool startup in San Francisco called IFTTT, and one during the school year doing big data-related things at a company called ResearchNow. I am currently interning at Uber for the spring semester, and I'll be at Google in the summer.

In this article, I'll be talking about how to land these jobs.

## Where to apply to

You should visit your school's career fair if you want local internships. This is a great option if you haven't had an internship before.

Hackathons are better than career fairs, however, because it shows that you have passion for what you do.

Make a list of apps and other kinds of services that you use normally, and get the companies associated with them. E.g. if you're a League of Legends fan, apply to Riot Games. It really helps to know the product beforehand, as during your interview you can even show what you'd do to improve it or what you like about it.

## Skills

Make sure you have the skills you need for the job.

For Dallas-area companies, usually it means you have written code before. Learn the skills that are required of the position you're applying for.

For SF Bay Area companies, it's a little tougher, especially for the more popular companies like Google and Facebook. You'll have to study algorithms, as they often ask coding questions at interviews. Read [Cracking the Coding Interview][ctci] and practice the questions. Also, make sure you know the skills you've listed on your resume in detail. If you can't talk about the skill for 5 minutes, you probably shouldn't have it on your resume.

Read [Getting a Gig][getting-a-gig] for more details.

## When to apply

It's ideal to apply in September to October, as that's when most companies start hiring summer interns. That doesn't mean you can't apply in the spring though -- startups especially hire year round.

## Your resume and cover letter

I'd explain this, but Cassidy Williams has already written a pretty good guide on this [here][getting-a-gig].

## Getting the interview

Getting the interview is one of the hardest parts, especially if you haven't had an internship before. I've listed some common techniques on accomplishing this.

### Use connections

Do you have a family member that works at the company? Great -- you can ask them to refer you. Make sure this family member knows how good you are so they give a good referral.

Build good relationships with your professors. Chances are they know people from major companies in the area. If they like you, they'll help you land interviews at companies.

If you have friends that have interned at places you'd like to intern at, let them know. They can refer you internally.

Furthermore, if you have friends that live in the area you'd like to intern at, chances are high that they know other people in technology in that area. You should ask them if they know any companies that are looking for interns.

### Get connections

Connections are very useful -- you should meet as many people as you can in your industry. They can help you land interviews and improve the company's opinion of you (and vice versa).

#### Collegiate Hackathons

If you don't have connections in the first place, hackathons are a really good way to meet companies from the area. Many Dallas-based companies sponsor and attend HackDFW, so make sure to interact with everyone that you may be interested in working for.

If you're looking for companies outside of Dallas (e.g. Bay Area companies like Google) you should attend out-of-state hackathons as well. Large companies tend to sponsor multiple hackathons, so it'd be very useful to know people from different parts of the company.

You should make your skill set clear to sponsors and show them why you'd be a good fit for their company. If they have a prize, try winning it -- they'll be more inclined to interview you if you've shown them that you are capable. Don't forget to exchange contact information.

#### Non-collegiate Hackathons

Often, at non-collegiate hackathons, people from companies will be participating. Make sure to meet the other people around you. If you're interested in potentially working with them, get their LinkedIn or business card and follow up after the event.

#### Meetups

Local meetups are full of people interested in technology. These kinds of people are always looking for motivated people to work with, and simply showing up to the event and being interested in the subject shows your drive.

Attend meetups of what you're interested in. If you're an app developer, look for Android/iOS meetups. If you're a web developer, look for JavaScript meetups, and so on.

The more niche the technology, the better -- an Erlang user group probably has a much harder time looking for people than a JavaScript one does.

Be sure to exchange LinkedIn's or business cards, and again, follow up.

Conferences are also great to attend, and they often have student discounts. They're also really fun, especially if they're in Las Vegas (e.g. Defcon). Go with friends!

### Cold emails

Emailing employees directly can get you far.

#### Large companies

I don't recommend this, as it's very difficult and doesn't really work. Likely, you'll end up annoying the person more than making them want to hire you.

#### Startups

Since there's not much overhead, employees have a lot of influence over who's hired.

If the startup is over 100 people, you may want to email employees working on the team you are interested in joining and describe why you really want to work on that team. You can even suggest a project that you could work on.

If it's smaller than this, you can probably email the founders directly. Again, suggest a project and explain why you'd be a good fit for the company.

I recommend not sending emails to more than 2 people if it's a startup, as they'll think negatively of you if you 've emailed everyone that works there.

### Apply online

If all else fails, apply online. Make sure you write a good cover letter specific to the company you're applying for.

## Interviewing

There's a lot of guides on this out there, but I believe [Cracking the Coding Interview][ctci] is a really good resource for this.

Make sure you can back up what you put on your resume.

## Other reading

There's a lot of material on the internet that's related to getting jobs. The following are some of my favorite:

There's a lot of ways to increase your chances of getting an internship. Don't just upload your resume to their website. Good luck on your search!
